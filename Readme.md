## About it

This project consists of developing a soft-starter to perform the acceleration and deceleration of a three-phase motor.

To accomplish this, it employs a PIC18F4550 microcontroller responsible for zero-phase crossing detection, control of 
TRIAC switching, a sensor for current measurement and a keyboard for adjusting the acceleration and deceleration times, 
both connected to the microcontroller. An LCD display shows all the data related to the operation.

The code was developed and compiled with the assistance of Microchip's MPLAB XC8 software.
